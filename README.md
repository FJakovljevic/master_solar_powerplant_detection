# Master Thesis - DETECTION OF SOLAR POWER PLANT FIELDS FROM SATELLITE IMAGES

This research paper presents an automated
system using deep learning, particularly a CNN with a U-
Net architecture, to detect and precisely locate solar
power plants in satellite images. Achieving an 88% IoU
overlap, the system streamlines renewable energy
monitoring, promoting sustainability.
